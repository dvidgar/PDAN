# PDAN Light
Implementation for the paper "PDAN Light: an Improved Attention Network for Action Detection".

The code is tested in Python 3.9.7 + PyTorch 1.10 environment with one Nvidia GTX 1070 GPU and the overall code framework is adapted from the [PDAN](https://github.com/dairui01/PDAN).

For training and testing this code, please download the Charades dataset from this [link](https://prior.allenai.org/projects/charades) and follow this [repository](https://github.com/piergiaj/pytorch-i3d) to extract the snippet-level I3D feature. The RGB-Pretrained PDAN can be downloaded via this [Link](https://mybox.inria.fr/f/9fa53012b2684cb588b5/?dl=1).
